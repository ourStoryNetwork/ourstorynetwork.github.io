<h2>0.9_b90training</h2>
<p>This is the second step after completing [b09onboarding](b09onboarding.md). Replace each word/phrase in the brackets [] below to draft a manifesto for your platform ecosystem's onboarding program.</p>
<a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company | Building Arc</a>
<br>

<p>The content below is a remix of The Browser Company’s landing page to help our decentralized team understand our vision. The intention is to (1) give us a place to start for crafting our vision based on a company who has proven success and (2) promote the work The Browser Company does in hopes of driving more people to use their products.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
What product are you creating? 
What category does it fit within? 
How can you describe it broadly enough to capture 
what you’re doing now and what you plan to do in the future?
Replace [institution] with the broad category 
of the product that you're creating.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>This is an [institution].</h2>

<hr/>
<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
How can you describe your product offering in really simple terms? 
What you’re creating is amazing, but let’s describe it 
in words a 7 year old can understand. What words can 
you use to describe your product, replace [an idea] and [some rules and 
social norms] with how you can describe your product in a simple way.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>It’s just [an idea], with [some rules and social norma].</h2>
<hr/>
<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
Is your product a portal, gateway, bridge, etc? 
What does your product connect people to? What industry 
is your product associated with? Replace [mental model] 
and [in our cities] with something that resonates with your brand.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>It’s our [mental model] for everything [in our cities].</h2>
<hr/>

<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
Look at your previous responses, what did you replace [in our cities] with? 
Let’s keep that train of thought going. What do you think is the biggest 
pain point for people who are using whatever you replaced [in our cities] with? 
The word that you use to replace [overwhelming] (unless you want to keep that 
in place), will be the basis of the problem slide in the pitch deck that we 
create for your ecosystem. What problem do the people you serve face?
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>We love [our cities], but [they] can be [overwhelming].</h2>
<hr/>

<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
What do you want your product to allow people and companies to do? 
What do they want instead of the current problem that they’re facing? 
Replace [an institution] with your product category and [help us make 
light of it all] with the solution that you think you can provide that category.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>What if [an institution] could [help us make light of it all]?</h2>
<hr/>

<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
What are three benefits that you think your product will bring your customers? 
Look at some research articles and whitepapers related to your industry, 
in the first couple of paragraphs, they’ll most likely point out a couple of 
the industry’s biggest challenges? What are the positive alternatives that 
people in your industry want? Replace [an institution] with your product category, 
[presence], [collaboration], and [self-sovereign] with positive outcomes that 
your product will provide. Replace [promote] with whatever makes the sentence read properly.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Could [an institution] [promote] [presence], [collaboration], and [self-sovereignty]?</h2>
<hr/>

<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
Replace [ourStory: Everything Is Music] with your company name.
Replace [design engineering] with any verb that describes how you 
want to bring your idea to the world. Replace [to build our cities] 
with a statement related to the industry you’re serving.
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>At [ourStory: Everything Is Music], we’re [design engineering] a better way [to build our cities].</h2>
<hr/>

<br>
{% highlight ruby %}
Alright! That should give you everything you need to replace the 
rest of the bracketed words below with statements that align with 
your brand. Send a message to your onboarding agent if you have any questions.

<p>When we think about [transforming our cities], we often ignore [the underlying institution]. Instead, we think about all the things we do [in public]---[the schools we attend], [the offices we avoid], [the festivals we enjoy]. The [tool] that enables it all, [the institution], is so ubiquitous that it’s ignored.</p>
<br>
<p>
    Despite the ways [our citywide planning] has evolved, [the institution] has remained relatively unchanged. While all of our [other social tools] are [innovating for the future]–with [machine learning], [blockchain technology], and [biomimicry innovation]---[the institution] largely still does what it did [since we started playing this game].
</p>
<br>
<p>
    What’s more, we blame ourselves for [the institution’s] shortcomings. When [our institution] has [an overwhelming amount of corruption], [we blame the “other” side]; when [we disagree with one another], [we tell ourselves we need more censorship]; [when can’t find a single “truth”], [we think we’re doomed]. Why does [the institution] get a free pass?
</p>
<br>
<p>
    That’s why we’re building a new [institution], which we call [hu3agency: we’re all right], because we believe [institution] can do so much more to empower us. We’re imagining [an institution] that can [elevate unbiased perspectives], [demystify how to change our neighborhoods], and [invest in our creative community projects]. [An institution] equipped for the way we use [the our cities] in 2023, and foundational for how we [plan] to use them in the future.

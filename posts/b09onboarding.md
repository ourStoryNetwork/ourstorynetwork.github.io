### 1.8 You've just completed your Onboarding Questionnaire. oS3's network is based on a proof-of-work protocol, and the first step is "peer-to-peer network formation."

#### To join oS3's peer-to-peer network, please create a Github Organization for your platform ecosystem and paste the link below.
[How to create a GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) (Make sure you choose to create a free organization)

```
https://github.com/ourStoryNetwork
```
#### Next you will "fork" your Onboarding Advocate's "lp09-onbpoarding-platform" repository to initiate your peer-to-peer network connection.
1. We're assuming we're your onboarding agent, so you can fork our onboarding repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/ourStoryNetwork/lp09-onboarding-platform)
2. Read through [How to fork a Github Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) to fork our onboarding repository (Only follow the steps in this section. There is no need for you to continue onto the "Cloning your forked repository" section)

#### Activate Github Discussions for your platform ecosystem
b09onboarding is related to the Language Institution for your platform ecosystem and Github Discussions is how people communicate on Github, so it's the main deliverable that you'll activate to complete the peer-to-peer network connection for your proof-of-work protocol.

#### Your Onboarding Advocate will join your platform ecosystem and share a design template to customize your organization's profile
As a heads up, your Onboarding Advocate will share the following template to the discussion that you created. This is just the template, but you will also receive two png files that you can immediately use.

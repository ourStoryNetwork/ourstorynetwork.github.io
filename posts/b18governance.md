With oS3, ourStory's governance is managed in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ourStoryNetwork/discussions).

The default governance protocol is a derivative of [Nostr](https://nostr.com/the-protocol). This is an MVP of the future Nostr client that ourStory is making for [The School of Bitcoin](https://theschoolofbitcoin.com) to help learners create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations that transform their cities.

## Platform Game
ourStory: Everything is Music uses oS3 (ourStory openSource operatingSystem) as a template for creating our platform ecosystem.

## Learn about oS3
A simple, open protocol that enables a truly censorship-resistant and local institutional netowrk.

## What is oS3
oS3 is a simple, open protocol that enables local, decentralized, and censorship-resistant institutional management.

## The Protocol
Details on how the oS3 protocol works and why:
### oS3 at a high level:
* There are two main components: Platform Teams (Producers / Longplays / LPs) and Platform Projects (Consumers / EpicPlaylists / EPs). Each person runs a Platform Team. Anyone can run a Platform Project.
* Every person is identified by a GitHub Profile (in the future, this will be a public key). Each of your posts are saved to your network. Every platform team has partners who validae these posts.
* Platform Teams fetch data from Platform Projects of their choice and publish data to contribute to the projects of their choice. Platform Projects don't talk to one another, only directly to Platform Teams. 

## Platform Players for ourStory: Everything Is Music
Everyone who creates their own Platform Ecosystem (DAO) with oS3 will define 4 distinct players that form a self-soverign community. Here are the players within ourStory.

| Platform Role         | Platform Player    | Discipline |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Owners | Agriculture Nonprofits      | Platform Engineering       |
| Providers      | City Agencies  | Machine Learning      |
| Producers      | Open Source Contributors  | Blockchain      |
| Consumers      | AEC Companies  | Biomimicry      |
